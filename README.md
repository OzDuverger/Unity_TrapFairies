# Unity_TrapFairies

I can not show you code of this project because it could spoiled you a fantastic escape room in Paris called *"Le Magasin de jouets"*. However I can show you some pictures of this app and explain what I have done on this existing project.

## Initial Problem

The game was too hard for some players and maybe too long for two players teams in the escape room.

## Two player team mode

In a first time I code a switch for two players team which needs to catch two fairies instead of five of them.
In this game mode all access are already open.

## Easy mode in game

In a second time I made an easy mode which can be switch during the game.
This mode open all closed access and makes appear new fairies.
This mode can also be reverted in game and in this case all new fairies disappear whereas all access still open.
