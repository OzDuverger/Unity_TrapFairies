# Unity_TrapFairies

I cannot show you the code of this project because it might spoil you the fantastic escape room in Paris called *"Le Magasin de jouets"*. However I can show you some pictures of the app and explain what I have already done for this existing project.

## Initial Problem

The game was too hard for some players and maybe too long for two-player teams in the escape room.

## Two-player team mode

In a first time I code a switch for two-player team which needs to catch two fairies instead of five of them.
In this game mode all access are already open.

## Easy mode in game

In a second time I made an easy mode which can be switch during the game.
This mode open all closed access and makes appear new fairies.
This mode can also be reverted in game and in this case all new fairies disappear whereas all access still open.
